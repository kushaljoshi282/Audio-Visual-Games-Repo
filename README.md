# Project Title

Audio-Visual-Games
CSCI 4830/7000 - Kane - Inclusive Design and Assistive Technology

## Getting Started

We are two friends who built this site from an idea to aid those who cannot see and hear. Through our class: CSCI 4830/7000 - Kane - Inclusive Design and Assistive Technology, we were able to work on the project throught the semester. We began with an idea for users that cannot see or hear, to be able to play thru a game with purely audio or visual cues, and a simple key bound interface. Our main goal was to create an interface that would allow for easy navigation of our game, which would be a generated story with mulitple outcomes based on your choices. When we began our project we were geared towards a more audio based experince, but as we progressed we realized that we could impliment visual based direction as well so that deaf people could enjoy our game as well. Thru numerous amounts of trial and error we came about with our finished product and hope you enjoy playing it just as much as we enjoyed making the game.

### Prerequisites

With a understanding of HTML, Javascript and Audio Recording, we were ready to embark on our quest.

### Programing 

Examples of some code that keeps the game running


* This switch statement allowed for user input from their keyboard
```
arrowKey = e.which||e.keyCode;
                switch(arrowKey) {
                    case 37:
                        window.location = "page2.html";
                        break;
                    case 39:
                         window.location = "page3.html";
                        break;
```

* This statement allowed for audio to be played automatically as the page opened

```
    <audio autoplay>
        <source src="Page1.m4a" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
```

## Code and Story

Extensive testing went into creating a cohesive storyline. With a project as such, we needed to make sure our storyline was just as good as our code, reducing redundancies and holes in our plot as well as our code. 

### Final Thoughts

All in all, after user tests with multiple people, we refined our project to be most pleasing visually, audio wise and story wise. Creating a game was a task that neither of us had handled and therefore we needed to change how we thought about the whole project, and we also needed to keep in mind that we were not creating just for a normal audience. Catering to those who could not see/ not hear, we needed to make sure there was a start to end flawless experience for these users, and after hours of code and audio mixing I think we can safely assume we did that.
