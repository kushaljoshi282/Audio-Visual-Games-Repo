Maya was still sobbing from Nathan's death, I grabbed her and hugged her. I began to cry too, I had made it, and while doing so I found my sister, someone who I thought I had lost forever. <br><br>Some troops came up to us, they helped us, gave us food and such a place to sleep. These troops were not like those scum, the ones who believed that they were the greatest race in the world. <br><br>That night I stayed up, lying in a bed, looking at the only thing I had left of my mom the photo of her and I. I looked at the bed beside me and my sister was fast asleep, the first night after so many restless nights. <br><br>I felt happy, for the first time I felt like I was a free man, a man not defined by a number tattooed on my body.
